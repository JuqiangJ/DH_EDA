# Simple modeling

Patterns in the data provide clues about relationship or covariation.

Models are a tool for extracting patterns out of data.

```{r}
ggplot(faithful)+
  geom_point(aes(eruptions, waiting))
```
```{r stats, fig.cap='stats', out.width='100%', fig.asp=.75, fig.align='center'}

knitr::include_graphics("img/stats.png")
